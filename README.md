# Customer_Churn_Analysis


# 🧮 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing customers at risk of churn using SQL, Python, and Power BI. It includes a logistic regression model to predict churn probability and a dashboard for executive-level decision-making.

## 📌 Business Problem

The business needed to reduce monthly churn, which had risen to 15%. We aimed to identify the at-risk cohort, understand key churn drivers, and recommend targeted actions to retain customers.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- **SQL** – Data extraction from customer behavior and billing history
- **Python** – Logistic regression using scikit-learn
- **Power BI** – Churn dashboard with KPIs, trends, and cohort analysis
- **EDA** – Exploratory analysis using pandas and matplotlib

## 📊 Results

- Identified a high-risk cohort with ~80% churn likelihood
- Recommended a retention strategy that projected a potential **8–10% churn reduction**
- Built a dashboard for ongoing churn tracking by segment and product line
