# Customer_Churn_Analysis


# ðŸ§® Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing customers at risk of churn using SQL, Python, and Power BI. It includes a logistic regression model to predict churn probability and a dashboard for executive-level decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Business Problem

The business needed to reduce monthly churn, which had risen to 15%. We aimed to identify the at-risk cohort, understand key churn drivers, and recommend targeted actions to retain customers.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques

- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction from customer behavior and billing history
- **Python** â€“ Logistic regression using scikit-learn
- **Power BI** â€“ Churn dashboard with KPIs, trends, and cohort analysis
- **EDA** â€“ Exploratory analysis using pandas and matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Results

- Identified a high-risk cohort with ~80% churn likelihood
- Recommended a retention strategy that projected a potential **8â€“10% churn reduction**
- Built a dashboard for ongoing churn tracking by segment and product line


## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- Test tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Automate dashboard updates with Power BI Service
